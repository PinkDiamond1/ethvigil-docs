# What is EthVigil

EthVigil presents an API gateway on top of Ethereum that allows one to write code to interact with blockchain value transfers and transactions as if it were talking to just another web service REST API over HTTP.

* You can focus on coding "business logic" without worrying about the "protocol logic" behind the scenes.

* Rely on our in-built caching, monitoring and fault-tolerant logic that powers the API.

* Configure further integrations with webservices (Webhooks/IFTTT applets/Websockets), email, slack and many more based on our monitoring system over smart contract events and specific Ethereum transactions.

# Why EthVigil

EthVigil takes care of the heavy lifting needed to conform with protocol specific logic like:

* private key management, upgradeable contracts, proxy patterns
* transaction lifecycle management
* Gas limits and transaction fees, execution optimization etc.
* Correct encoding and decoding of transaction data

This allows developers to quickly deploy and build on smart contracts over EthVigil API gateway with minimal knowledge of Ethereum, usually reducing the lifecycle of blockchain application development by a factor of 80%.

The API gateway is **not a mere relay** that maps HTTP API calls to blockchain protocol commands but rather, **a state machine** that attempts to stay as close to the globally accepted version of chain of blocks.
